      <ul style={{ listStyleType: "disc", paddingLeft: "1.5rem" }}>
        <li>I took every character that showed up in your file and made it into a leaf node, each one labeled with its character and how often it appeared.</li>
        <li>Then, like a matchmaker for bytes, I kept finding the two nodes with the lowest frequencies and merged them into a new parent node. This parent‚Äôs frequency is simply the sum of its two children.</li>
        <li>I repeated this merging process‚Äîalways picking the two smallest‚Äîuntil only one node remained at the very top: the root of the Huffman tree.</li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <p style={{ textAlign: "center", fontStyle: "italic" }}>
        This special binary tree is cleverly structured so that the most frequent characters end up closer to the root, which means their paths (and codes) are shorter and compression is more efficient!

      </strong>
      <p style={{ fontWeight: "bold" }}>
        With the Huffman tree built, I assigned a unique binary code to each character in your file:{" "}
      </p>
      <em> This binary sequence corresponds exactly to the edges traversed from the root down to each character‚Äôs leaf node.</em>
      <br />
      For every character in your file, I traced a path from the root of the tree down to that character‚Äôs leaf node. Starting from the root node of the tree, a ‚Äò0‚Äô, is added to the code whenever the path moves to a left child node, and a ‚Äò1‚Äô is added whenever it moves to a right child node.
      This traversal produces a distinct sequence of bits (0s and 1s) for each character based on its path through the tree.
      <br /> <br />
      <p style={{ textAlign: "center", fontWeight: "bold" }}>
        By replacing every character in your data with its binary code, I transformed your original text into a long, compressed stream of bits‚Äîready for the next stage!
      </p>
    </div>,

  <div key="packBinaryData" style={{ whiteSpace: "pre-line", fontSize: "0.8rem" }}>

    <p style={{ textAlign: "center" }}> üì¶ GROUPING THE BINARY CODE INTO BYTES</p>
  </strong>
<p style={{ fontWeight: "bold" }}>
  Now that your entire message is encoded as a continuous stream of 0s and 1s generated from the Huffman tree, I prepared this binary data for efficient storage and display.
</p>
  <br/>
    <p>
    When we look at text, we see one character like a letter or a space as a single item. But a computer does not see it that way. It reads every character as a group of <strong>8 bits</strong>, which together form one byte.
  </p>
  <p>
    So while one character looks like one thing to us, the computer actually treats it as <strong>8 individual bits</strong>.
  </p>
  <br/>
  <p style={{ fontWeight: "bold" }}>
    To make this easier to work with, we group these 8 bits into bytes. Then, instead of showing all 8 bits, we convert each byte into a two-digit hexadecimal (hex) value.
  </p>
  <p>
    This means that the computer&apos;s 8-bit byte can be represented as just <strong>2 hex characters</strong>. So rather than dealing with 8 separate bits, we use 2 hex digits to represent the same information&mdash;making it easier to read and manage.

        The original file you uploaded had a size of <strong>{originalSize}</strong> bytes.
